### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software testing specialist improving and sharing my knowledge in Test Automation.
Here you will find repositories with test automation scripts written mostly in Java and JavaScript.
I have repositories for three test levels: unit test, integration (API) and UI test. All repositories associated with specific test levels are named as <ProgrammingLanguage>_<TestFrameworks>_<TestLevel>_<OPTIONAL_AND_ADDITIONAL_INFORMATION>. For example, a repository that was written in Java programming language, using JUnit 5 testing framework and it is associated to Unit test level is "[Java_JUnit5_Unit_Test_handsOn_ViradaDaQualidade](https://github.com/marcelodebittencourt/Java_JUnit5_Unit_Test_handsOn_ViradaDaQualidade)"

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on software testing projects on finance segment.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning JavaScript and how to automate tests using JavaScript (unit, API and UI).
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on software testing projects from the most initial level (unit testing) until the most widely testing level (UI testing).
